## Calendar Tracker Web App

This is a simple web application to keep track of the number of days spent out of the country in a 12 month period. It is intended for use by anyone making a visa application in the UK who wants to check this number meets the requirements.

The app was initially set up using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/).

### TODO

* Write more tests (!)
* Set up Travis CI.
* Ensure Flow coverage as close to 100% as possible.
* Improve responsiveness and styling.
